        <h2>The field of robotics is continuously advancing, thanks to ongoing technological innovations that are expanding the capabilities of robots. Key technologies include:</h2>

        <h3>Sensors</h3>
        <p>Sensors play a critical role in robots' ability to perceive and understand their environment. They enable robots to detect objects, navigate obstacles, and gather information necessary for their tasks.</p>
    
        <h3>Actuators</h3>
        <p>Actuators are responsible for the movement and interaction of robots with their surroundings. They enable robots to manipulate objects, perform precise actions, and carry out tasks efficiently.</p>

        <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a vital role in robotics by empowering robots to analyze data, learn from experiences, and make intelligent decisions. AI algorithms enable robots to adapt, improve their performance over time, and interact with humans in a more natural and intuitive manner.</p>
